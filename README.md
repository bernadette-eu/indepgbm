## Summary
We consider a flexible Bayesian evidence synthesis approach to model the age-dependent transmission dynamics of COVID-19 based on daily age-specific mortality counts. The temporal evolution of the age-specific transmission rates in populations containing multiple types of individuals is reconstructed via independent diffusion processes which are assigned to the time-varying key epidemiological parameters. A diffusion-driven susceptible exposed infected retired-type model with age structure is used to capture the age-specific trends in the latent counts of infections and to account for fluctuations in transmission that are influenced by non-modelled phenomena like public health interventions and changes in human behaviour. We analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Greece and Austria and validate the proposed Bayesian model using the estimated age-specific counts of cumulative infections from a large-scale seroprevalence survey in England.
